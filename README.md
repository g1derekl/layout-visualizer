Visualize the placement of the finger holes in a bowling ball.

## Introduction

High-performance bowling balls have irregularly-shaped weight blocks in their cores that are specially designed to induce gyration when the ball spins about a certain axis, helping it "hook" (curve) into the pins to maximize the chances of getting a strike. Therefore, it is important to drill the finger holes in a location such that when the bowler rolls the ball down the lane, the axis of rotation is at a point that allows the weight block to generate the optimal amount of gyration.

The orientation of the weight block is marked by a "pin" on the surface of the ball, while another mark indicates its center of gravity (CG). On bowling balls with "asymmetrical" weight blocks, a third mark shows the point at which the mass is at its most uneven between the two halves; this is known as the mass bias. With these points, along with the bowler's "positive axis point" (PAP), which is a measurement of the axis of rotation in relation to their hand position as they release the ball, a skilled ball driller can fine-tune the ball's drilling layout to suit each individual player.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
